# GitHub Action Runner Orchestrator

Kotlin script to manage GitHub Action Runners on self-hosted machines.

[![Latest release](docs/src/assets/images/badge-release-latest.svg)][releases]
[![License](docs/src/assets/images/badge-license.svg)](LICENSE)

## About the project

This script helps to manage GitHub action runners for multiple GitHub repositories.

The script has been developed against Kotlin 1.7.20 and is using kotlin-shell and ktor.

## Getting started

You need to create a GitHub personal access token with repo permissions and set it as environment variable in your
system: `export GITHUB_ACTIONS_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN={token}`

## Usage

Clone the project on your desired runner machine and create a `orchestrator_config.json` file following this example:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "version": "2.298.2",
    "folder": "github-action-runners",
    "isArm": false
  },
  "repositories": [
    {
      "organization": "ORG_NAME",
      "name": "REPOSITORY_NAME",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Add the desired *organization* and *repository names* that you want to this machine to register to as GitHub runner.

Then just run the orchestrator: `./run-orchestrator.sh`

It will create a new folder `github-action-runners` where all repository runners could be found. Every runner will be configured as a service.

If you set the repository config enabled to false, the runner will be uninstalled and removed for that repository.
